About me

I'm a student of SRM University currently pursuing Computer Science Engineering. I'm a passionate individual on a perpetual journey of self-discovery and growth. With a curious mind and an insatiable appetite for learning, I thrive on exploring the intricacies of life and the world around me. Whether delving into the realms of literature, science, or art, I find joy in the pursuit of knowledge and the beauty of diverse perspectives. As an avid adventurer, I cherish the experiences that push me out of my comfort zone, fostering resilience and adaptability. A creative spirit at heart, I express myself through various outlets, be it through writing, art, or engaging conversations. Connecting with people and understanding their unique stories is something I deeply value. Life, to me, is a canvas waiting to be painted with the vibrant strokes of experiences, and I am excited to continue this ever-evolving masterpiece.
